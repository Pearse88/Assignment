1st assignment for OOP

Introduction
</br>
The dataset I have based my assignment on, is one that is very close to me.  Having been a diehard Glasgow Celtic Footbal Club fan for the whole of my life, I thought it would be a interesting journey for myself to learn more about the fanbase of the club I love.  When I first set out about finding a suitable dataset it appeared it was going to be dificult to find a specific subject to base the assignment on. </br>
The dataset that was decided upon was the average attendances at Celtic home games from a time period between 1980 and 2014.
